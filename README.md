# wazuhevtx

A Python tool and library that parses EVTX files and converts them into JSON formatted logs mimicking Wazuh agent behavior in version 4.x. wazuhevtx is designed as a helper for `wazuh-logtest` tool.

Now, you can test your detection capabilities by replaying known attack samples such as [Windows EVTX Samples](https://github.com/sbousseaden/EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES).

**Note: It runs on Windows-only!** See Caveats below.

## Installation

### Alternative 1: Clone this repository

* Simply `git clone https://github.com/zbalkan/wazuhevtx.git` and start playing wih it.
* initiate your favorite virtual environment.
* Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run the script by providing the path to evtx file.

### Alternative 2: Use `pip`/`pipx`

If you plan to use the library and CLI:

* initiate your favorite virtual environment.
* Install the module using `pip install wazuhevtx`
* Run the script by providing the path to evtx file. Or you ca just use `import wazuhevtx`

If you want to use only CLI tool:

* Install the module using `pipx install wazuhevtx`
* Run the script by providing the path to evtx file.

## Usage

### As a CLI tool

```yaml
usage: wazuhevtx [-h] [-o OUTPUT] evtx

A Python tool and library that parses EVTX files and converts them into JSON formatted logs mimicking Wazuh agent behavior in version 4.x. wazuhevtx is designed as a helper for wazuh-logtest tool.

positional arguments:
  evtx                  Path to the Windows EVTX event log file

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Path of output JSON file. If not defined, output will be printed to console.
```

### As a library

You can use the package as a library to integrate into your scripts.

```python
from wazuhevtx.evtx2json import EvtxToJson

for log in converter.to_json(evtx_file):
    print(log)

```

## Caveats

### Windows-only

Due to Windows API dependencies of `win32evtlog`, the script works on Windows systems only. If you try on a Linux or Mac environment, you will get "This script is intended to be run on Windows." message, and the script will exit with error code 1.

### Workaround for testing

In order to be able to test with `wazuh-logtest` utility, you need a workaround as we are sending JSON logs, not `event_channel` format.

* Navigate to `/var/ossec/ruleset/rules/0575-win-base_rules.xml` file.
* Update the rule 60000 this way:

```xml
<rule id="60000" level="2">
    <!-- category>ossec</category -->
    <!-- decoded_as>windows_eventchannel</decoded_as -->
    <decoded_as>json</decoded_as>
    <field name="win.system.providerName">\.+</field>
    <options>no_full_log</options>
    <description>Group of windows rules.</description>
</rule>
```

### Corrupted EVTX files

If you encounter this error below, you will see that you cannot parse event logs. That is because I utilize Windows APIs, and by default the API does not provide a way to read or recover corrupted sections. If the file is corrupted, you cannot read it as a whole. I suggest using third party tools lie `CQEVTXRecovery` to recover files before using with `wazuhevtx`.

```plaintext
Error: The event log file is corrupted. (1500)
```

### Log Provider missing

It is possible that the log provider is missing on your computer. For instance, you may not have Sysmon installed on the analyst workstation, therefore the formatted message may be missing. Then, you will face the error message in the event's message field `Failed to get metadata for provider Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon`. This is by design. You cannot get metadata from a provider that does not exist. If you plan to use `message` field in detections, beware of the error message.

## Thanks

Thanks to [Birol Capa](https://github.com/birolcapa) for [his article](https://birolcapa.github.io/software/2021/09/24/how-to-read-evtx-file-using-python.html) pointing to the simplest way to parse EVTX files. Before that I tried many different solutions that were limited after some point.
